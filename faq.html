      there wouldn't be thousands of people downloading it every month.
    <p>
      I am often asked this question; to me it represents a misapprehension. You
      wouldn't go up to a paintbrush maker and ask if he thought there were already
      enough watercolor paintings. A font is a work of art and represents the
      individual genius of its creator. It is no more redundant than a watercolor.
    <p>
      However, accepting the question at face value, here are my attempts to answer
      it... er, pragmatically.
      <ol>
        <li>
          There are lots of latin fonts. There are far fewer greek, cyrillic, indic,
          thai, chinese, japanese, korean, unicode...
        <li>
          There aren't many good quality free fonts available.
        <li>
          Researchers into old writing systems often need to design their own fonts
        <li>
          Even for latin, traditionally each new style of art and architecture has
          an associated style of fonts. New fonts are always being created to reflect
          the esthetics of the times.
        <li>
          Computer font technology is constantly changing. A font-format that was useful
          10 years ago may not be so now.
        <li>
          Even if you are satisfied with the fonts that do exist they may not be complete
          <ul>
            <li>
              Missing ligatures
            <li>
              Missing accented glyphs
            <li>
              No matching cyrillic or greek glyphs
          </ul>
        <li>
          Everybody wants a font of his/her own handwriting.
        <li>
          Playing with fonts is fun.
      </ol>
    <p>
      FontForge has uses beyond simply creating and modifying fonts. It can convert
      from one format to another. It can extract information from the font file.
      Or it can simply show you what the font looks like without having to install
      it.

        </a>
        <dd>
          I wanted a widget set that would handle Unicode reasonably well. In particular
          I thought support for bidi text was important for hebrew and arabic typography.
          As I was unaware of any widget sets that did that, I wrote my own.<br>
          I also wanted a widget set where I could actually figure out whether the
          checkbox was checked or not checked. In far too many cases my eyes can't
          work out which is which... (Ironically the most frequent complaint I get
          is from people who can't tell whether my checkboxes are checked. I don't
          know what to make of that).<br>
          I realize now that that there are essentially two free widget sets that are
          far better at unicode support than mine. These are
          <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt">QT</a> and
          <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">gtk</a>. I'm still not using either because:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Converting from one set of widgets to another is tedious. And people send
              me bugs which distract me.
            <li>
              If I spend my time doing that conversion I won't be making FontForge more
              functional.
            <li>
              QT is written in C++, and, <a href="faq.html#C-plus-plus">
                as I explain

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The support for images is atrocious (which is odd, since it was written for
                  gimp):
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      There is no support whatsoever for client side bitmaps (and I want to support
                      bitmap fonts)
                    <li>
                      Colors are ordered RGB in color tables for index images, but BGR for 24bit
                      color images
                    <li>
                      No simple support for transparent images without resorting to full RGBA images,
                      which is a bit of overkill when I want to draw a simple bitmap.
                    <li>
                      There is no overarching format for images, so I can't have an image which
                      itself knows whether it's bitmap, index or truecolor.
                    <li>
                      Fixing these was possible, but it involved a lot of very low level work on
                      my part -- and I only know how to do that work on X.

                <li>
                  I also can't figure out how to modify the file chooser to make it behave
                  the way the fontforge's file chooser currently behaves (popup windows showing
                  FontNames as you move the mouse over fontfiles, a pull down list of recently
                  used files attached to the filename input box, etc.)

                <li>
                  Many of the widgets I want to use have been deprecated. Sometimes I can't
                  figure out what replaces them, sometimes I am forced to used a far more complex
                  widget instead.
                <li>
                  So I tend to wrestle with it for a while and then decide than my current
                  widgets are better after all.
                <li>
                  I did get a limited version of fontforge running under gtk. I would be greatful
                  if someone else would choose to extend and maintain it.

              Why C++

          </b>
        </a>
        <dd>
          I've been a little surprised to be asked this question, I had not realized
          my choice of language needed justification, but it appears to do so...
    <p>
      Basically because I don't find object-oriented practices helpful in most
      cases, because I find C++ far too complex and badly designed, and because
      I can't debug it easily.
      <ul>
        <li>
          I grew up with SIMULA and dabbled with SmallTalk and found after a few years
          that there were very few problems where an object oriented approach seemed
          natural to me. In most cases it just seemed to impose unneeded complexities
          on the problem.
        <li>
          The semantics of a C++ program cannot be specified. The compiler is free
          to generate temporaries as it wishes. In C this is not a problem, but in
          C++ the creation of a temporary can involve calling a constructor and a
          destructor which may have untold side-effects. I find this frightening.
        <li>
          The order of execution of external constructors is unspecified. I have seen
          many inexplicable bugs caused by this
        <li>
          I find it extremely difficult to debug C++. Stepping through a statement
          often involves many unexpected procedure calls (some of which are inlined
          and not obvious). This distracts from my main purpose in debugging.
        <li>
          Finally I find the language badly specified and too complex. Its various
          concepts do not fit well together. Each compiler seems to do things slightly
          differently.
    <p>
      I first met C++ in about 1981 when it was called C with Classes. I wrote
      the C++ front end for Green Hills Software's compiler suite from 1987 to
      1994 and I tracked each new version of the language from 1.1 to ANSI.
    <p>
      Each version added new features which did not sit well with the old ones.
      Each version was badly specified. The reference implementation was wildly
      different from the specification. For example the behavior of virtual functions
      inside constructors was not specified until version 2 of the language and
      since this behavior was different from naive expectations this caused bugs.
      My favorite confusion occurred in (I think it was) the version 2.1 specification
      where on one page, within a few paragraphs, the following two sentences occurred:
      "Unions may contain member functions." and "Unions may not contain member
      functions.".
      </ul>
    <p>
      The above are my personal opinions based on my experience and explain why
      <i>I</i> do not use C++. Your opinions probably differ, few people have spent
      5 years writing C++ compilers.

      I'm giving away fontforge, so I do.

      me, and include my copyright notice if you use my code" and that's all I
      care about.
    <p>
      Perhaps I am naif, but I don't believe that anyone is going to start selling
      fontforge. Why would they? It makes no sense for someone to try to sell what
      I give away freely. If they add functionality to fontforge, then that's a
      different matter, but in a sense they aren't charging for fontforge, they
      are charging for the code they have added to it. It would be annoying if
      someone did that, a bit rude in my eyes, but I'm not going to say "no".
    <p>
      Now someone might take a small piece of fontforge and use it in something
      else. That doesn't bother me. I know that some of my OpenType code has been
      snagged by some TeX packages. And I have snagged code for generating checksums
      from some other packages.

        </b>
        <dd>
          I dislike dependencies. The fewer the better.
    <p>
      I hate when I download a package and discover it won't work unless I download
      half a dozen other packages (which, in their turn may demand that I download
      yet more packages).
    <p>
      I want to download a package and just have it work.
    <p>
      So I try to write as much code myself as I can and release it all together
      in a lump and not force people to wander all over the web looking for disparate
      parts.
    <p>
      When I can't figure out how to do something myself I will use an external
      library if I must. Even then I will try to insure that fontforge will run
      if the library is not present on a system. When I release a binary package
      I don't want to have to release 32 packages per host depending on the possible
      presence or absence of 5 different libraries. But I also don't want to force
      someone to install a library that s/he will never use just to get fontforge
      to start.
    <p>
      If a user will never look at an svg glyph then they don't need to install
      libxml2. If the user will never import a jpeg image (and there's really no
      reason to want to do that) then they don't need to install libjpeg.
    <p>
      Instead, the binaries I release will try to load a library dynamically (dlopen)
      <em>when they need it</em> and not before. This will also speed up starting
      fontforge. If the library is on the system then all is happy and nice. If
      the library is not, then that functionality is lost -- but the rest of fontforge
      continues to work.

      Mostly because I don't thnk that way. I don't plan things out, I have a vague
      idea where I want to go and I explore in that direction.
    <p>
      Consider python scripting. I decided to add python to fontforge. I found
      that meant it became easier to design a mechanism so users could create their
      own scripts to add import/export file formats. And then startup scripts,
      and scripts when certain standard "events" happened. And then I could allow
      users to define their own menu items. And then I figured out how to add fontforge
      to python (as opposed to the reverse). And now I realize that there is no
      reason I couldn't define a set of c-bindings so that people could call fontforge
      as a library from within C programs. And who knows where that will lead --
      if anywhere.
    <p>
      Each stage means I can see a little further, and go a little further, and

          I like to make things. I like to make things that -- in some strange definition
          are beautiful. I'm not sure how that applies to making bread, but my pots
          -- I think I make beautiful pots. And I really like the glazing I put onto
          them.
    <p>
      It's harder to say that a font editor is beautiful. But I think the ideas

        <a name="legal"><b>Is it legal to modify a font? Is it ethical?</b></a>
        <dd>
          Many current fonts are based on the work of great designers from centuries
          past -- so reusing other people's designs has a long history. On the other
          hand, no matter what the law, it is clearly unethical to steal the work of
          a living designer.
    <p>
      Legal matters vary from country to country (and perhaps within countries).
      You really should consult a lawyer for a definitive answer. Here are some
      guidelines:
    <p>
      Look at the license agreement you received with the font and see what it
      has to say on this issue.
    <p>
      TrueType (and OpenType and potentially CID-keyed fonts) have a field in the
      OS/2 table called FSType which allows the font designer to place restrictions
      on what other people can do with the font. If this field prohibits modification
      fontforge will ask you to make sure you have an agreement with the font designer
      which supersedes this field.
    <p>
      My understanding of US law (but check with a lawyer before relying on this)
      is that:
      <ul>
        <li>
          There is minimal legal protection for font designs. Ages ago some legal figure
          claimed "The alphabet is public." This meant a type design could not be
          copyrighted.
    <p>
      However (I'm told) a designer may register (with the government) for a design
      patent which protects the design for 14 years (if granted). I don't believe
      it can be renewed, but I may be wrong.
    <p>
      Registering for a patent is an expensive and time-consuming process and is
      often outside the ability of a small design firm. As far as I know the law
      has never been tested in the US so the protection may be questionable.
      <li>
        Font <em>programs</em> (such as a postscript or truetype font file, but not
        a bitmap font file) may be copyrighted. This means the design itself is not
        protected, but the mechanism for creating it is.
      <li>
        Font names may be trademarked.
        </ul>
    <p>
      My understanding is that in the UK:
      <ul>
        <li>
          There is something called a "design right" which is somewhat like a copyright
          and protects a design for 5 years. A designer may also register the design
          with the government up to 5 times to extend this protection to 25 years.
      </ul>
    <p>
      Throughout the EU:
      <ul>
        <li>
          There are EU design rights. I'm not sure about the specifics of these, nor
          how they interact with country specific laws (as the British design rights
          above).
      </ul>
    <p>
      In Canada:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Font designs may be registered as "industrial designs" for a limited time
          (~15 years)
      </ul>
    <p>
      I would welcome any additions or corrections here, as well as info on the
      laws governing fonts in other countries. There is a
      <a href="http://typophile.com/node/42709">thread on typophile</a> which discusses
      this.

          (What measurement
          of the font determines the point size?)
        </b>
        <dd>
          <img src="/assets/img/old/pointsize.png" width="147" height="96" align="right">A font is
          12 points high if the distance between the baselines of two adjacent lines
          of (unleaded) text is 12 points.
    <p>
      The pointsize is not based on the sizes of any of the glyphs of the font.
    <p>
      Back when fonts were made out of metal, the pointsize of the font was the
      height of the metal slugs used for that font.
    <p>
      In some sense this is not a very good measure of the size of a font (some
      fonts may allow more room for accents or ascenders or descenders than others
      meaning that the height of the actual glyphs will be smaller).
    <p>
      There is also a measurement scheme based on the x-height of the glyphs.
    <p>
      In England and the US a point has traditionally meant the pica point
      (1/72.27<sup>th </sup>of an inch), while in Europe the point has been the
      didot point (1/67.54<sup>th</sup> of an inch). The Europeans have a slightly
      larger point, but the glyphs of English and European fonts appear the same
      size. English does not use accents (except in very rare cases) while most
      European languages do, and the slight increase in the size of the point allows
      more room for accents.
    <p>
      (Of course now most Europeans are probably forced to use the pica point by
      their desktop software, while most computer fonts now contain accented glyphs,
      so the distinction and the reason for it may have vanished).

        <a name="linespace"><b>How do I set the line spacing on a font?</b></a>
        <dd>
          It depends on the kind of font you are generating, the operating system under
          which you are running, and luck.
          <ul>
            <li>
              For Type1 fonts there is no way to set the line spacing. Applications will
              often take the values specified in the font's bounding box and use those
              to set the line spacing. This is a really bad idea on their part, but it
              is common practice.
            <li>
              For True/Open Type fonts the answer is complicated.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  On the mac<br>
                  The line spacing is set by the ascender and descender values of the 'hhea'
                  table. These in turn are set to the bounding box values of the font. Not
                  a good choice. You can control these values from
                  <a href="fontinfo.html#TTF-Metrics" target="_top">
                    Element-&gt;Font
                    Info-&gt;OS/2-&gt;Metrics
                  </a>.
                <li>
                  On windows<br>
                  Line spacing is supposed to be set to the Typo Ascent/Typo Desent values
                  specified in the OS/2 table. And these in turn are supposed to sum to the
                  emsize. (FontForge sets these values to the ascent/descent values you specify
                  for your font). Unfortunately most windows applications don't follow this
                  rule, and instead base linespacing on the Win Ascent/Descent values of the
                  OS/2 table. These values are supposed to specify a clipping region for the
                  font (not line spacing). The clipping region should be as big as the font's
                  bounding box, but in some cases needs to be bigger. Again these may be set
                  from <a href="fontinfo.html#TTF-Metrics" target="_top">
                    Element-&gt;Font
                    Info-&gt;OS/2-&gt;Metrics
                  </a>.
    <p>
      (The clipping region should be bigger than the bounding box if a GPOS lookup
      could move a glyph so that it extended beyond the bounding box (mark to base
      is likely to cause problems). I'm not sure how this applies to cursive
      positioning in Urdu where GPOS lookups can make lines arbetrarily tall)
    <p>
      MicroSoft has added a redundant bit to the OS/2 table, which essentially
      tells applications they should follow the standard and use the Typographic
      linespacing fields. This bit is called UseTypoMetrics in OpenType, and in
      FontForge it is available as Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;OS/2
      -&gt;Metrics-&gt;Really Use Typo Metrics.
      <li>
        On linux<br>
        I don't know that there is a general consensus. An application will probably
        use one of the above methods.
        </ul>
        </ul>
    <p>
      Actually this is not a very useful question any more. Modern fonts tend to
      have several different scripts in them and the different scripts may have
      different line spacing requirements. Even within one script there may be
      differences (English uses no (or extremely few) accented letters, while most
      other European languages use accents, thus English could be set more densely
      than German).
    <p>
      Instead of having one global measurement which controls the line spacing
      for all uses of the font, it is better to have more specific measures which
      control the line spacing dependent on conditions. The OpenType
      <a href="baseline.html" target="_top">'BASE' table </a>does this. It allows
      you to specify extent data depending on script, language and active feature
      (for example, a 'mkmk' feature might increase the line spacing). I don't
      know whether any applications actually make use of these data
      <dt>
        <a name="em-units"><b>How big will my glyphs be?</b></a>
        <dd>
          Unfortunately this seemingly simple question cannot be answered. Your glyphs
          may be any size. Outline glyphs may be scaled and even bitmap glyphs will
          be different sizes depending on the screen resolution.
    <p>
      Suppose instead that you have an outline font that you draw at 12 points.
      Then we can answer the question.
    <p>
      Suppose you have a dash glyph that is 500 internal units long, and the font
      has an em-size of 1000 units. Then your glyph will be 500/1000 * 12 = 6points
      long. On a 72 dpi screen this will mean the dash is 6 pixels long.
    <p>
      <b>What are em-units? (internal units?)</b>
    <p>
      When you create your font you can use
      <a href="fontinfo.html#PS-General" target="_top">
        Element-&gt;Font
        Info-&gt;General
      </a> to provide an em-size for your font. This is the sum
      of the typographic ascent and descent (in the days of metal fonts, the height
      of the metal slugs, the baseline to baseline distance). Generally the em-size
      will be 1000 or 2048. This gives you the number of internal units (also called
      em-units) used to represent em.
    <p>
      Within fontforge outline glyphs are displayed using the coordinate system
      established here. See also the

      When it loads a font FontForge expands it into a more intuitive (well intuitive

      It would probably be possible to rewrite FontForge to use a more efficient
      memory representation. But this would be an enormous amount of work and doesn't

                  highlights
    <p>
      Essentially you designate one (or several) directories as a "font directory".
      You move your fonts to that directory. You build up certain data structures
      that X needs, and you tell X to include this directory in your font path.
      Sadly different versions of X and the X font server use slightly different
      conventions. You may need to alter these procedures a bit.
    <p>
      For example, if you want to install a <em>bdf font </em>called frabnuts-13.bdf
      then you might:
      <blockquote>
        <pre>$ mkdir my_fonts
$ mv frabnuts-13.bdf my_fonts
$ cd my_fonts
$ bdftopcf frabnuts-13.bdf &gt;frabnuts-13.pcf
$ mkfontdir
$ xset fp+ `pwd`
</pre>
      </blockquote>
    <p>
      and your fonts should be installed. After that, whenever you start X you
      need to remind it of where your fonts live, so you should add<br>
      <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ xset fp+ /home/me/my_fonts</code><br>
      to your .xsession (or equivalent).
    <p>
      If you want to install <em>postscript fonts</em><br>
      You should generate them as postscript binary (.pfb) files, then move both
      the .pfb and the .afm file into (one of) your font directory(ies) and run
      <a target="_top" href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=type1inst">type1inst</a>
      in it.<br>
      type1inst will probably complain that your font doesn't have a foundry and
      will probably get the encoding wrong. You can either:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ignore it and nothing bad will happen
        <li>
          Manually edit fonts.scale after running type1inst to fix these entries
        <li>
          Make your font's Copyright be reasonable, and then edit type1inst and add
          your foundry (directions for this are in type1inst itself)
      </ul>
    <p>
      If you want to install <em>truetype fonts</em><br>
      You move the .ttf file into your font directory and run mkttfdir and
      mkfontdir.<br>
      (<a target="_top" href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=mkttfdir">mkttfdir</a>
      has a small problem with fonts created by FontForge, it will almost invariably
      complain that it doesn't recognize the foundry. You can safely ignore this,
      but if it bothers you then add a line to ttmkfdir.c at 936<br>

      Some versions of X (ie, those shipped by redhat) rely on the x font server
      to do font work rather than the X server itself. You may need to use chkfontpath
      to add your new directory to the font server's font path (rather than xset
      fp).<br>
      You may also need to insure that the font directory (and all its parent
      directories) are readable to world. (the font server runs as a non-privileged
      user)
    <p>
      I haven't seen anything that says X supports <em>opentype</em> fonts yet,
      but since freetype does (and I think X's rasterizer uses freetype) then X
      might support them too. Installing them will require manual editing of
      fonts.scale though (mkttfdir uses freetype1 which doesn't support otf files).
    <p>
      That sounds really confusing. I apologize, I'm not a good writer and there
      are too many choices in configuring X...

          Oh dear. The mac sticks fonts into resource forks and wraps them up in its
          own headers. Mac fonts aren't compatible with anybody else's. FontForge can
          create a resource fork if it wraps the font up in a macbinary encoding. See
          the <a href="faq.html#How-mac">following question</a> for more information.<br>

              Mac OS/9 (or less)
            <dd>
              Traditionally the macintosh has stored fonts in the resource fork of files
              (after about OS/8.5 I believe the mac also supported bare .ttf files). This
              causes problems for any machine other than a mac, because the very concept
              of a resource fork is lacking.<br>
              There are several programs whose job it is to store all of a macintosh file
              in one package that can be manipulated on other systems (mac binary and binhex
              are the most common). FontForge knows how to read both of these formats and
              can extract a postscript or truetype font from either. FontForge can also
              create fonts in macbinary format (I see no reason to support both output
              formats, and macbinary is slightly simpler).<br>
              So to edit a font on your mac:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Find the file in the <tt>System Folder:Fonts</tt> folder
                <li>
                  Copy the file over to your unix machine
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Use Fetch and specify macbinary format
                    <li>
                      Or use some tool like binhex which can create the file directly
                  </ul>
                <li>
                  Open it in FontForge
                <li>
                  Edit it
                <li>
                  Save it back in macbinary format
                <li>
                  Copy it back to your mac
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Fetch will automatically undo the macbinary wrappers and make it be correct
                    <li>
                      Or various other tools can unwrap it.
                  </ul>
                <li>
                  Drop it back into your system folder (where it is automagically moved to
                  Fonts)
              </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> make sure you either replace the original font files,
      or that you rename the font within fontforge and (for postscript fonts) that
      you give it a new unique id. See the <a target="_top" href="fontinfo.html">

      <strong>Caveat:</strong> A postscript font is useless on a macintosh unless
      it is accompanied by at least one bitmap font. If you generate a postscript
      font make sure you also generate an NFNT as well (this has the FOND).<br>
      <strong>Caveat:</strong> The mac is picky about the filename used to contain
      a postscript file. It is based on the postscript font name but suffers a
      transformation. Don't try to rename this file. Basically the rules are (see

      Mac OS/X does not seem to support the old NFNT bitmap format, but it still

      a resource-based postscript font. (It is probably not the NFNT resource which
      is required, but the FOND which goes along with it. But I'm not going to

              For the Style menu in most mac applications to work on your fonts, you must
              create a font family. You do this with the
              <a target="_top" href="filemenu.html#GenerateMac">
                File-&gt;Generate Mac
                Family
              </a> command.
    <p>
      All the fonts in a family must have the same Family name (See the
      <a target="_top" href="fontinfo.html">font info</a> dialog). Font Families
      are handled rather differently under Carbon (the old font handling mechanism
      used in OS 9) and under ATSUI (on OS/X).
    <p>
      Under Carbon, the font family is limited by the design of the Mac 'FOND'
      resource, which reflects the computer font technology of the early 1980s.
      Modern computer fonts often have variants that can't be expressed in it.
      FONDs support any combination (except one containing both Extend and Condense)
      of the following styles:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Bold
        <li>
          Italic
        <li>
          Condense
        <li>
          Extend
        <li>
          Underline
        <li>
          Shadow
        <li>
          Outline
      </ul>
    <p>
      Mac FONDS do not support "Black", "DemiBold", "Light", "Thin" or
      "Extra-Condensed" variants.
    <p>
      Under ATSUI, on the other hand, a family seems to consist of all fonts in
      a given resources file which have the same FamilyName.
    <p>
      In order that a family be useful under both systems, Apple appears to place
      several FONDs inside such a font file. Each FOND contains a sub-family of
      related fonts. The 'FOND's appear to be distributed as follows:
    <p>
      Suppose you have a family of fonts with the following styles:<br>
      Regular, Bold, Italic, Bold-Italic, Condense, Condense-Italic, Oblique, Light,
      Light-Italic, Black<br>
      Then you should create a font family with the styles that the FOND does support,
      which in this case would be<br>
      Regular, Bold, Italic, Bold-Italic, Condense, Condense-Italic<br>
      For each of these use
      <a href="fontinfo.html#FONDName" target="_top">
        Element-&gt;Font
        Info-&gt;Mac
      </a> to set the FondName field to the font's family name.
    <p>
      Change the fondname of the other styles, so that the Oblique style has Oblique
      in the fond name, the two Light styles have Light in the fond name, and so
      on. Set the <a href="fontinfo.html#Mac-Style" target="_top">Mac Style</a>
      on the "Light" variant of the font to be Regular (everything unselected)
      and set the style of the "Light-Italic" variant to be "Italic" -- that is,
      forget about the "Light", the FOND can't handle it, that's why we moved it
      into its own FOND.
    <p>
      Having done this setup, the <a href="filemenu.html#GenerateMac">
        Generate
        Mac Family
      </a>command should be able to put all the fonts into appropriate

      This is really a limitation on ATM's part and there's nothing FontForge can
      do about it.
    <p>
      If you generate a font with an encoding other than Macintosh Latin, then
      the Mac's default behavior is to force the postscript font to have a Macintosh
      Latin encoding. There is a mechanism to turn this behavior off, but if it
      is turned off then ATM won't work at all.

          The X server does not have a good idea about screen resolution, and when

          fonts that are too small (potentially too big too, but no one has complained
          about that one yet). You can tell fontforge the true screen size by adding
          a line like
          <blockquote>
            <pre>Gdraw.ScreenWidthInches: 14.7
Gdraw.ScreenWidthCentimeters: 37.3

      to your <code>~/.Xdefaults</code> file (The general mechanism is discussed

          First ask yourself if you really need a new encoding? If you are using OpenType
          or TrueType fonts you can usually get by with the standard unicode encoding.
          But if you really need a new one here is a rough idea of what to do:
    <p>
      Figure out what your encoding looks like. Often this will involve searching
      around the web to find an example of that encoding. For instance if you want
      a devanagari encoding you might look at
      <a target="_top" href="http://www.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/indic.html">
        a
        site which shows the ISCII encodings
      </a>
    <p>
      These encodings only show the top 96 characters, presumably the others are
      the same as US ASCII. Look at the images and figure out how they map to unicode
      (or more precisely what the appropriate postscript names are for those
      characters).
    <p>
      Create a file (call it "Devanagari.ps" in this case). It should start with
      a line:
      <blockquote>
        <pre>/Devanagari {
</pre>
      </blockquote>
    <p>
      This tells FontForge that the encoding is called "Devanagari", then follow
      this with a list of all the character names (preceded by a slash). We start
      with ASCII which starts with 32 .notdef characters, then space, etc.
      <blockquote>
        <pre>/Devanagari {
 /.notdef
 /.notdef
 ...
 /.notdef
 /space
 /exclam
 /quotedbl
 ...

 /.notdef

 /uni0901
 /uni0902
 ...
 /uni096F
}
</pre>
      </blockquote>

      Now load this file into FontForge's list of encodings with Encoding-&gt;Load

        <b><a name="non-integral">Is it safe to use non-integral coordinates?</a></b>
        <dd>
          FontForge allows you to edit with non-integral coordinates. Many font editors
          don't and some have wondered if the use of non-integral coordinates will
          it distort their fonts when they are rasterized?
    <p>
      The answer depends on the font format and how you save the font.
    <p>
      TrueType fonts can only express integral coordinates. When FontForge creates
      a TrueType font it will round all coordinates to integers. This rounding
      will introduce a slight distortion in the curve.
    <p>
      PostScript (type1, PostScript OpenType, type2, etc.) fonts can express
      non-integral coordinates in the font format -- but it takes a lot more space
      in the font file. Type1 fonts tend to take more space to express this than
      type2 (opentype) fonts. By default FontForge will round to int on these as
      well, BUT you can change that in the Generate Options dialog.
    <p>
      If your font is rounded then there will be some distortion. If it is not
      rounded there should be no distortion. In PostScript fonts it should be safe
      to use non-integral coordinates provided you turn off rounding when you generate
      the font. The font file will be bigger, but more accurate.
    <p>
      If you feel you need more accuracy in TrueType you can change the em-size
      to 8096.
    <p>
      You can do this on PostScript Type1 fonts too, however, there are some
      applications which assume that all OpenType postscript fonts have an em-size
      of 1000, so it is best not to do this for OpenType output.

        <dd>
          This is probably because you didn't round to int before saving the font.

        <dd>
          Both PostScript and TrueType define a file format and a glyph format. OpenType
          uses the TrueType file format with a PostScript glyph format (actually OpenType
          includes the TrueType glyph format as well, but the OpenType definition says
          such fonts should still be called TrueType fonts so I ignore that aspect).
    <p>
      The PostScript used in OpenType is slightly different from that used in .pfa
      and .pfb files. pfa/b files are Type1 fonts while OpenType uses Type2 fonts.
      Type2 is almost a superset of Type1 with a few minor changes and many extensions.
      Adobe's subroutine based extensions to Type1 (flex hints, hint substitution,
      counter hints) have been added to Type2 as direct instructions.<br>
      OpenType can also include additional information (see
      <a href="#AAT-Open">below</a>) that allows for the layout of complex scripts
      (Arabic, Indic, etc.) as when as support for glyph variants and other aspects

              Even though you haven't changed anything in this session, FontForge may need

              those glyphs have been changed (in an earlier session) but no hints have

              If your font has an XUID field in the Font Info, then FontForge will increment
              the final number in the XUID each time a postscript font is generated --
              and this also counts as a change. (Why does FontForge do this? Because Adobe
              says it should. A minor annoyance, but it avoids some problems with font

          As Knuth said "(the problem with WSYWYG is that...) What you see is

      <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;top<sub>1</sub>y<sub>2</sub> = CapHeight</code><br>

      interpret this? It could:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Change <code>CapHeight</code>
        <li>
          Change the width of pen 1

          Change the equation to something like:<br>

          Some background:
    <p>
      When postscript was invented every glyph in a font was given a name, and
      an encoding which was specified by a 256 element array mapping character
      codes to names.
    <p>
      Then they started thinking about CJK fonts (and perhaps Unicode), which have
      huge glyph sets, and coming up with reasonable ASCII names for 10,000 glyphs
      was <small>a)</small> a waste of space, <small>b)</small> fairly meaningless.
      So then adobe created CID-keyed fonts which have no glyph names and no encodings.
      Every glyph has an index (a CID), which is just a number, and this is sort
      of treated as a name. Then external to the font is an additional resource
      (a cmap) which provides the encoding for the font (and can support really
      grungy encoding schemes like SJIS), by mapping a sequence of input bytes
      to a CID.
    <p>
      Adobe provides certain standard cmap resources (ie. one for SJIS, one for
      JIS, one for Extended Unix whatever). Because these files are fairly painful
      to write Adobe has assigned standard meanings to CIDs so that everyone can
      use the same cmap file. -- Well actually there are 5 or 6 different standards,
      Japanese (JIS208), Japanese (JIS212), Korean, Chinese (Hong Kong, Taiwan),
      Chinese (Mainland, Singapore), Identity (Unicode) -- So CID 1 might be space,
      CID 2 might be "!", CID 935 might be "Katakana ka", etc.
    <p>
      My cidmap files just give me a mapping between Adobe's CIDs and Unicode.
      This allows FontForge to know what glyph it is working on. If they aren't
      present things should work ok, but FontForge would fill the font view with
      "?" rather than the appropriate glyph. And FontForge wouldn't be able to
      reencode the font into Unicode or anything else.
    <p>
    <p>
      So the cidmap files are only useful for people working on CID keyed CJK fonts.
      So many europeans/americans won't need them.

          If the glyph named ".notdef" contains some splines (but no references) then
          it will be used as the default glyph (that is the glyph used when an unencoded
          glyph is called for).
    <p>
      Except that in a OpenType font (that is, a PostScript OpenType font), the
      .notdef glyph is not used for the default glyph, instead the "space" glyph
      is. (Don't look at me, I didn't write the spec.)

          </b>
        </a>
        <dd>
          When FontForge reads in a truetype font it saves all the hinting (instructions)
          that were present in the original. But if you change a glyph in any significant
          way those instructions are no longer valid (they depend intimately on the
          details of the outlines), so FontForge removes them when you make a change.
          The result is that changing a glyph with FontForge will degrade its appearance
          in most truetype fonts (not all, some have no hints).<br>
          FontForge can generate truetype instructions for you itself, but you must
          ask it to do so -- use the Hints-&gt;AutoInstr command.

          Unfortunately Apple and MicroSoft (and Adobe) do not agree on the proper

          As far as I can tell Windows will mark a truetype font with the "O" icon
          if that font contains a 'DSIG' (Digital Signature) table. FontForge does
          not produce digital signatures (I think they are of negative utility, and

        <a name="names"><b>What do all the different font names mean?</b></a>
        <dd>
          When <code>Element-&gt;Font Info</code>opens it shows a Names pane with several
          different fields. Why are there so many and what do they all mean?
    <p>
      The Names pane contains names used in PostScript fonts. There is also a
      <code>TTF Names</code> pane which contains a similar set of names used in
      sfnts (an sfnt is a font file format which includes truetype, opentype, and
      a number of more obscure font formats).
    <p>
      A font may be PostScript wrapped in an sfnt. In this case it can have both
      a set of PostScript names, and a set of sfnt (ttf) names. Those names could
      be different (that's usually not a good idea, but they <em>could</em> be).
    <p>
      The "name for humans" is the name traditionally associated with a font. It
      might be something like "ITC New Century Schoolbook Italic #4". It's a string
      which applications can use to display when they want humans to know what
      the font is.
    <p>
      The fontname exists because PostScript is a programming language and this
      is the name used to identify the font <em>within PostScript</em>. It has
      restrictions on the characters which may be in the name (no spaces is the
      biggest. but it also can't look like a number, no parentheses, etc.) and
      on the length of the name. It might look like "ITCNewCenturySchoolbook-Italic".
    <p>
      The family name is the name of a family of related fonts. In the above example
      "ITC New Century Schoolbook" would probably be the family name.
    <p>
      "Base Filename" isn't really a name associated with the font itself. It's
      just there to make your life easier when using fontforge. When you generate
      a font, ff will pick a default filename for you (you can always change it,
      of course, but it is handy if the default name is the one you want to use).
    <p>
      Normally the default name will be just the fontname with an extension added
      (ITCNewCenturySchoolbook-Italic.ttf). But sometimes people want a different
      name for the default, perhaps just NewCentSchlBk-Ital.ttf. This lets you
      do than.
    <p>
      So it controls the default FILENAME for the file containing the font, and
      does not directly relate to anything in the font itself.
    <p>
      The weight string is something like "Bold", "Black", "Thin", etc. It does
      not include other stylistic variations (you would not put Italic or Condensed
      here).
    <p>
      The copyright string should be self-explanatory.
      <hr width="50%">
      In addition to the "Names" pane of Font Info, there is also a TTF Names pane.
    <p>
      In many ways this is a duplicate of the Names pane but with some differences.
      It is used to specify names for sfnts.
    <p>
      Here you have
      <ul>
        <li>
          Family<br />
          This corresponds to the PostScript Family
        <li>
          SubFamily<br />
          Vaguely like the weight field, but takes all stylistic varients not just
          weight.<br />
          This might be "Bold", "Italic", "Bold Italic", "SemiBold", "Condensed",
          ...<br />
          Whatever is appropriate for your font.
        <li>
          Fullname<br />
          This corresponds to the "Name for humans"
        <li>
          Copyright
      </ul>
    <p>
      Generally FontForge will set all these fields appropriately (ie. same as
      in the Names pane). If you don't like the name ff chooses you can disassociate
      it from the PS name by right clicking on the entry and choosing from the
      popup menu.
      <hr width="50%">
      Further complicating things, there are fields
      <ul>
        <li>
          WWS Family
        <li>
          WWS SubFamily
      </ul>
    <p>
      I don't really understand why these are needed, but MicroSoft thinks they
      are. As far as I can tell they should (in most cases) be the same as Family
      and SubFamily above, and should therefore be omitted.
      <hr width="50%">
      CID fontname should be ignored unless you are building a CID keyed font (which
      usually means you are working on a CJK font).
      <hr width="50%">
      Compatible Fullname<br />
      Is another name I don't see the need for. I think it should be the same as
      Fullname, and should be omitted.
      <hr width="50%">
      TTF Names may be specified in more than one language and writing system.
      The entry which is translated most frequently is SubFamily. So for an Italic
      font, you would have an English entry "Italic", and perhaps
      <ul>
        <li>
          French, Italique
        <li>
          German, Kursiv
        <li>
          Dutch, Cursief

          Some truetype fonts (kaiu and mingliu are examples) do not store the correct

          just positioned. FontForge will not process the instructions as it reads
          the font. In most fonts this would be the wrong thing to do, and I don't

          For some reason Unicode has unified greek and latin accents even though they

          Unicode also contains code points for the greek accents starting around U+1FBD,
          if you fill these code points with the appropriate accents then FontForge
          will use these rather than the latin accents.

        <dd>
          One of your stems is a little taller than the other. FontForge centers accents
          over the tallest point on the glyph. If there are several points with the
          same height, then an average is used.

        <dd>
          Buy more memory?
    <p>
      If you are editing large fonts, FontForge may run out of memory. All too
      often when FF runs out of memory, the kernel will crash rather than report
      an error condition. FontForge does check for failure to allocate and attempts
      to free up some chunks of memory when the system returns an error -- I've
      never seen this code activated though.
    <p>
      FontForge does provide a mechanism which might help you avoid this. FontForge
      generally wastes a lot of memory keeping undoes around. You can clear undoes
      associated with a glyph with the Edit-&gt;Remove Undoes command. You can
      also limit the number of undoes that will be stored with each glyph with
      the File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Editing-&gt;UndoDepth.
